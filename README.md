# Classical-AI
This GitHub repository is dedicated to storing and managing all the AI Alogrithms that we learn and implement in our AI course in 3rd semester at Sitare University. Throughout the semester, I will be working on various Algorithms that are used in games and puzzel solving in real life. In this course our main objective is to learn AI algorithms and analyse their behaviours and real life applications in the field of AI and Computer science. There all are self implemented code which I am putting here.

I cordially invite you to explore the codebase and give your valuable feedback and suggestions.
